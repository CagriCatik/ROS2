## Introduction

This project aims to leverage the capabilities of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) within a Docker environment. The combination of ROS 2 and Docker offers numerous advantages, including simplified deployment, cross-platform compatibility, and efficient development workflows. This README.md provides an overview of why ROS 2 and Docker are chosen for this project, details on building multiplatform Docker images for ROS 2 development, and instructions for using the Docker images.

## Why ROS 2 and Docker?

ROS 2 is chosen as the primary framework due to its extensive capabilities for robot development and its growing popularity within the robotics community. Docker, on the other hand, is selected for its ability to encapsulate applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. The key reasons for using ROS 2 and Docker in this project are as follows:

1. **ROS 2 Advantages**: ROS 2 offers a comprehensive suite of tools and libraries specifically designed for robotics development. It provides support for various hardware platforms, communication protocols, and middleware, making it an ideal choice for building complex robotic systems.
2. **Docker Benefits**: Docker simplifies the deployment process by packaging applications and their dependencies into containers. These containers can run consistently across different environments, ensuring reproducibility and eliminating dependency conflicts. Additionally, Docker facilitates cross-compilation and building applications for multiple platforms, which is crucial for deploying ROS 2 applications on both desktop machines and low-power devices like Jetson Nano.

## Multiplatform Docker Build

To support deployment on both x86/amd64 and arm64 architectures, multiplatform Docker images are built using Docker Buildx. This approach enables the creation of Docker images compatible with both desktop machines and Jetson Nano devices. The Dockerfile provided in this repository demonstrates how to build base Docker images with CUDA and ROS 2 for both architectures.

## Docker Image Building Process

The provided Dockerfile outlines the process of building a base Docker image that includes CUDA and ROS 2 components. Key steps in the Docker image building process include:

- Installation of necessary dependencies and tools for ROS 2 development.
- Compilation and installation of ROS 2 from the source.
- Integration of additional packages and libraries required for specific applications (e.g., PCL, OctoMap).
- Configuration of the Docker environment to support both x86/amd64 and arm64 architectures.

## Running the Docker Image

Once the Docker image is built, it can be executed on either a desktop machine or a Jetson Nano device using the following command:

```bash
docker run \
  --rm \
  -it \
  --runtime nvidia \
  --network host \
  --gpus all \
  -e DISPLAY \
  ${REGISTRY}/ros2_base:latest \
  bash
```

This command launches the Docker container with GPU support (`--runtime nvidia`) and access to the host network (`--network host`). It also enables GPU acceleration (`--gpus all`) and forwards the display environment variable (`-e DISPLAY`) for GUI applications.

## Conclusion

By combining ROS 2 with Docker, we have created a versatile development environment that supports cross-platform deployment and efficient application development. The Docker images generated using this approach provide a solid foundation for building and deploying ROS 2 applications on a variety of hardware platforms. As we continue to develop this project, we will explore additional Docker images tailored to specific robotic applications, further enhancing the capabilities of our development environment.

# rqt and rqt_graph in ROS 2

In this tutorial, we will delve into `rqt` and `rqt_graph`, essential tools in ROS 2 for debugging and visualizing your node graph. This guide aims to provide a thorough understanding of these tools, their functionalities, and how to use them effectively.

## Overview of rqt

`rqt` is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool in ROS 2 that aids in debugging and visualizing various aspects of your ROS system. It is a framework that aggregates various plugins, each serving a specific purpose such as monitoring node activity, visualizing messages, and managing parameters.

## Launching rqt

To launch `rqt`, you can simply use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
rqt
```

This command starts the `rqt` GUI, which initially presents an empty screen. This empty screen is expected because `rqt` operates using plugins, and no plugins are loaded by default.

## Using rqt Plugins

To utilize `rqt` effectively, you need to load the relevant plugins based on your debugging needs. For this tutorial, we will focus on the `rqt_graph` plugin, which visualizes the node graph.

1. **Start rqt**: Open a terminal and execute:
   ```sh
   rqt
   ```
2. **Load rqt_graph Plugin**: In the `rqt` GUI, go to `Plugins` > `Node Graph` > `rqt_graph`. This action loads the node graph visualization plugin.

## Understanding rqt_graph

The `rqt_graph` plugin provides a graphical representation of the ROS 2 computational graph, showing nodes and the topics they publish or subscribe to. This visualization helps in understanding the interconnections and data flow between nodes.

### Initial State of rqt_graph

When you first load `rqt_graph`, you may see an empty graph if no nodes are running. The graph updates dynamically as nodes are started or stopped.

## Running and Visualizing Nodes

To populate the node graph, you need to start ROS 2 nodes. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Start a ROS 2 Node**: Open a terminal and run a node. For example, if you have a Python node in your package:
   ```sh
   ros2 run my_python_package my_node
   ```
2. **Refresh rqt_graph**: Go back to the `rqt_graph` window and refresh it. You should see your node appear in the graph.

## Example: Running Multiple Nodes

To illustrate how `rqt_graph` works with multiple nodes, let's run another node:

1. **Start Another Node**:
   ```sh
   ros2 run my_python_package another_node
   ```
2. **Refresh rqt_graph**: Refresh the `rqt_graph` window again. Now, you should see both nodes.

## Node Communication

Nodes in ROS 2 can publish and subscribe to topics to communicate. In `rqt_graph`, you can visualize these connections:

1. **Node Independence**: Initially, you may see that nodes are independent with no connections.
2. **Publish/Subscribe Relationships**: If nodes publish or subscribe to the same topic, `rqt_graph` will display lines representing these relationships.

## Using ros2 CLI for Node Management

You can also manage and inspect nodes using the `ros2` command-line interface (CLI):

1. **List Nodes**:
   ```sh
   ros2 node list
   ```

   This command lists all active nodes.
2. **Node Information**:
   ```sh
   ros2 node info /node_name
   ```

   This command provides detailed information about a specific node, including its publishers, subscribers, and services.

## Advanced rqt_graph Usage

For more advanced usage, `rqt_graph` can be launched directly to quickly access the node graph:

```sh
ros2 run rqt_graph rqt_graph
```

This command provides a faster way to visualize the node graph without navigating through the `rqt` GUI.

# Conclusion

`rqt` and `rqt_graph` are powerful tools in ROS 2 that facilitate the debugging and visualization of your ROS system. By effectively using these tools, you can gain insights into the node graph, understand inter-node communication, and quickly identify and resolve issues.

This tutorial covered the basics of starting and using `rqt` and `rqt_graph`, running nodes, and visualizing node connections. As you continue working with ROS 2, you will find these tools invaluable for maintaining and troubleshooting your robotic systems.
